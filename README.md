I'm @Xenoxys1, known by close friends and relatives by Arthur Moraes.
My interests are a little confusing since I'm still learning new things almost every day, but I could say I enjoy making things that I can improve anytime with what I know.
The language that I most know about is Java, and I'm currently studying with it.
For now, I don't have any interest in any sorts of collabs or jobs.
If you want to contact me I can provide an Email, but as I said above, I'm not looking for any kind of job or collab.
There aren't many fun facts about me, but I'm on the way to learn more than I can until the end.

Here you can see in a few details about myself:

- What I know: Java, Computer Graphics, Database and HTML
- Going through High School
- Portuguese speaker, with an advanced level of English
- Currently coursing in Computer Tech School
- Not focused on any projects at the time
